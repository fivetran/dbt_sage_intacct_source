# dbt_sage_intacct_source v0.4.0

## Breaking Changes
- Reintroduced `_fivetran_deleted`. 

# dbt_sage_intacct_source v0.3.1
[PR #16](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_sage_intacct_source/pull/16) includes the following updates:

## Bug Fixes
- Included the `sage_intacct__using_bills` variable as an enablement config for the following models as it was erroneously omitted in previously releases:
    - `stg_sage_intacct__ap_bill_item_tmp`
    - `stg_sage_intacct__ap_bill_tmp`

# dbt_sage_intacct_source v0.3.0

[PR #14](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_sage_intacct_source/pull/14) includes the following updates.

## ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes ðŸš¨:
- Removal of the `_fivetran_deleted` field from the `stg_sage_intacct__gl_detail` table due to this field being deprecated within the connector. The relevant information is now available within the `gl_batch` source table.

## Bug Fixes
- Cast the `class_id` field within the following models as `{{ dbt.type_string() }}` in order to ensure datatype consistency for the field across models. This also ensures downstream transformation logic within `dbt_sage_intacct` compiles successfully.
    - `stg_sage_intacct__ap_bill_item`
    - `stg_sage_intacct__ar_invoice_item`

## Feature Updates
- Addition of the `gl_batch` source and relevant downstream models:
    - `stg_sage_intacct__gl_batch_tmp`
    - `stg_sage_intacct__gl_batch`

## Under the Hood
- Updated Maintainer PR Template
- Included auto-releaser GitHub Actions workflow to automate future releases

# dbt_sage_intacct_source v0.2.1

A very spoooOOOOOooooky release ðŸŽƒ ðŸ‘»

## Bug Fixes
- Explicitly casts `department_id`, `location_id`, and `item_id` as strings in the staging `ap_bill_item` and `ar_invoice_item` models, which are unioned together downstream in [`sage_intacct_ap_ar_enhanced`](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_sage_intacct/#!/model/model.sage_intacct.sage_intacct__ap_ar_enhanced) ([PR #12](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_sage_intacct_source/pull/12)).

## Under the Hood:
- Incorporated the new `fivetran_utils.drop_schemas_automation` macro into the end of each Buildkite integration test job ([PR #11](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_sage_intacct_source/pull/11)).
- Updated the pull request [templates](/.github) ([PR #11](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_sage_intacct_source/pull/11)).

# dbt_sage_intacct_source v0.2.0

## ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes ðŸš¨:
[PR #10](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_sage_intacct_source/pull/10) includes the following breaking changes:

    - `any_value`
    - `bool_or`
    - `cast_bool_to_text`
    - `concat`
    - `date_trunc`
    - `dateadd`
    - `datediff`
    - `escape_single_quotes`
    - `except`
    - `hash`
    - `intersect`
    - `last_day`
    - `length`
    - `listagg`
    - `position`
    - `replace`
    - `right`
    - `safe_cast`
    - `split_part`
    - `string_literal`
    - `type_bigint`
    - `type_float`
    - `type_int`
    - `type_numeric`
    - `type_string`
    - `type_timestamp`
    - `array_append`
    - `array_concat`
    - `array_construct`
- For `current_timestamp` and `current_timestamp_in_utc` macros, the dispatch AND the macro names have been updated to the below, respectively:
    - `dbt.current_timestamp_backcompat`
    - `dbt.current_timestamp_in_utc_backcompat`
- Dependencies on `fivetran/fivetran_utils` have been upgraded, previously `[">=0.3.0", "<0.4.0"]` now `[">=0.4.0", "<0.5.0"]`.

# dbt_sage_intacct_source v0.1.2
 
## Updates
- Removed the `_fivetran_deleted` filter in the `stg_sage_intacct__gl_account`. We saw there were records in the `gl_detail` table that were associated with accounts that were deleted, which affected our joins and bubbled up later in the final P&L and balance sheet models. By removing the filter the balances tie out. However, we've kept `_fivetran_deleted` as a column so the user may filter that out on their own.
([#8](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_sage_intacct_source/pull/8))

# dbt_sage_intacct_source v0.1.1
 
## Updates
- Excludes fivetran-deleted rows in the staging models
([#7](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_sage_intacct/issues/7))

- Allow for pass-through columns from the  `gl_detail` and `gl_account` source tables using the following variables. For more information please refer to the [README](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_sage_intacct_source/blob/main/README.md#passthrough-columns)
    - `sage_account_pass_through_columns`
    - `sage_gl_pass_through_columns`

- Add variable configs for the AP Bill and AR Invoice related tables to allow users to disable them if not used. For more information please refer to the [README](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_sage_intacct_source/blob/main/README.md#disabling-and-enabling-models)
    - `sage_intacct__using_bills`
    - `sage_intacct__using_invoices`

- Include additional fields in the `gl_detail` model: customer_id, customer_name, department_id, department_title, location_id, location_name, vendor_id, and vendor_name.
